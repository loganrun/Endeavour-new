                        <br>
                        <small>December 13, 2014</small>
                    </h2>
                    <p>     Software is becoming a critical layer of all our lives. It is the language of our world. In the future, not knowing the language of computers will be as challenging as being illiterate or innumerate are today.  Yet there's no guarantee that computer science will be offered at your child's school; in fact, there's a good chance it won't be. Despite the chorus of future-focused experts advocating for better computer science education, most schools aren't meeting the challenge.</p> 
                
                    <p>How essential is it that our children learn t progam?  Consider this. Most of our communications are based on social networks. Many businesses rely on their fans, friends, and followers to generate profit and be able to provide quality products for the society. At the center of all of these systems are computers.  They provide the very backbone and nerve center of our ecenomy.  Without computer programers, the whole system as we know it could collapse.</p>

                    <p> As a result of this growing dependence, there is a huge market available for those who decide to take action today and start learning how to read and write code.  The US Department of Labor has estimated that there will be approximately 1.2 million software engineering jobs avaiable in 2022 with a median income of $93,000 dollars a year. The opportunity existing right now is signifigant as there are not enough people trained to fulfill current computer science engineering jobs.  The demand for highly skilled indiviuals is high now and will only increase as technological advancces continues to push forward. </p>
                    
                    <p>This is not only about equipping the next generation to work as software engineers, it is about promoting computational thinking. Computational thinking is how software engineers solve problems. It combines mathematics, logic and algorithms, and teaches you a new way to think about the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>The applications of this approach stretch beyond writing software. Fields as diverse as mechanical engineering, fluid mechanics, physics, biology, archeology and music are applying the computational approach. In business we are beginning to understand that markets often follow rules that can be discerned using computational analysis. <br></br>Computational thinking is a skill that everyone should learn. Even if you never become a professional software engineer, you will benefit from knowing how to think this way. It will help you understand and master technology of all sorts and solve problems in almost any discipline.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are a parent who is looking for some fun activities for your kids; you definitely want to try coding.  Join us this summer.  We will make coding fun, creative and informative.  We can't wait to see what your children will create! </p>
